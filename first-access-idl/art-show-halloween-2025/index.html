                    Hero: Idea was to have an animation similar to what I found 
                    with "Welcome to the FIRST Access IDL Halloween 2025 Art 
                    Show!" I was hoping that we could get one (or 2, or 3) of 
                    the FIRST ACCESS members to create it.

                    Photo in Footer Banner: Currently its an image pulled from 
                    the school's official site. Will need permission to use. Or 
                    use my oringal idea of having a DP First Access Member take 
                    new photos for use - Must be similar in style to what our 
                    school is doing for the official site, that way it feels 
                    connected when the links take viewers to the 
                    brochure/application pages.
