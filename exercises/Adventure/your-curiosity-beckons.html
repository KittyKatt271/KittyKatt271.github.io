                    The new path - it beckons to you, calling you just as the sirens of 
                    old. And Your curiosity - it overtakes you. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you place your first step upon the path, an eerie wind blows 
                    through, and your horse calls out. The loud whinny seems to break 
                    whatever hold this new road has placed on you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You turn back to comfort your horse. Upon staring into his jet-black 
                    eyes, you notice that the horse seems to be looking anywhere and 
                    everywhere but the new road.
                </p>
