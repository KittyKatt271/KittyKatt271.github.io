        <p>
            The new path - it beckons to you, calling you just as the sirens of 
            old. And Your curiosity - it overtakes you. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As you place your first step upon the path, an eerie wind blows 
            through, and your horse calls out. The loud whinny seems to break 
            whatever hold this new road has placed on you.
        </p>

        <p>
            You turn back to comfort your horse. Upon staring into his jet-black 
            eyes, you notice that the horse seems to be looking anywhere and 
            everywhere but the new road.
        </p>

        <p><i>Is this perhaps a warning?</i></p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Do you heed your steed's warning?</b> 
            &nbsp;
            <b>Or do you ignore him?</b>
        </p>
