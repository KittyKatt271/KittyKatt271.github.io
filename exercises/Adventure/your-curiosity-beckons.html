        <p>
            The new path - it beckons to you, calling you just as the sirens of 
            old. And Your curiosity - it overtakes you. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As you place your first step upon the path, an eerie wind blows 
            through, and your horse calls out. The loud whinny seems to break 
            whatever hold this new road had placed on you.
        </p>

        <p>
            You turn back to comfort your horse. Upon staring into his jet-black 
            eyes, you notice a most terrified gaze - the horse refuses to look 
            upon the new road.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Do you heed your steed's warning?</b> 
            &nbsp;
            <b>Or do you continue on this new path?</b>
        </p>
