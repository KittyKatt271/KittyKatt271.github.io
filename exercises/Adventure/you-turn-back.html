                    Seeing your horse desperately try to break free has caused you to 
                    lose your nerve. Something is wrong, and you decide to turn back.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You untie your horse from the tree and return to the main road. 
                    After a short spell, your horse seems to have calmed down. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    You don't know what was waiting for you at the end of that new road 
                    - and now, you never will. But somehowâ€¦ you are content with not 
                    knowing.
                </p>
