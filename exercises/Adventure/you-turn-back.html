        <p>
            Seeing your horse desperately try to break free has caused you to 
            lose your nerve. Something is wrong, and you decide to turn back.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You untie your horse from the tree and return to the main road. 
            After a short spell, your horse seems to have calmed down. 
        </p>

        <p>
            You don't know what was waiting for you at the end of that new road 
            - and now, you never will. But somehowâ€¦ you are content with not 
            knowing.
        </p>

        <h3>The End</h3>
