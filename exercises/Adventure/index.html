        <p>
            As a traveling merchant, you are no stranger to the road. However, 
            upon your usual <br> 
            route to the Castle Town Market, you notice something odd.
        </p>

        <p>
            A new road, so new it has yet to be cobbled, has branched off from 
            the main road.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can't help but to wonder, <i>“How curious?”</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Do you keep to the main road?</b> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            <b>Or does your curiosity get the best of you?</b>
        </p>
