                    As a traveling merchant, you are no stranger to the road. 
                    However, upon your usual route to the Castle Town Market, 
                    you notice something odd.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A new road, so new it has yet to be cobbled, has branched 
                    off from the main road.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can't help but to wonder, <i>“How curious?”</i>
                </p>
