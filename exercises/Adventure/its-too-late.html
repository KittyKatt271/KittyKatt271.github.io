        <p><i> “Hmm… Maybe You should…”</i> </p>

        <p>
           Before you can complete your thought, a feeling of dread washes over 
           you and a wind as black as the unseen void blows past, eradicating 
           the main road and your caravan.
        </p>

        <p>
            You quickly look around. The world around you seems to have 
            disappeared, even the ground itself. All that remains is the road 
            you're standing - this new path.
        </p>

        <p>
            With nowhere else to go, you venture forth hoping it leads back to 
            the realm you knew. But as you progress, the surrounding nothingness 
            only seems to darken and the sense of dread only grows.
        </p>
