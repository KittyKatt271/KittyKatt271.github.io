        <h1>A Fair Warning</h1>

        <img

        <p>
           <i>“Sssshhh….”</i> You whisper, in an attempt to comfort your horse.
        </p>

        <p>
            But your pleas to calm him, they are not working. Whatever lies 
            beyond that path, has spooked the poor thing beyond imagining. With 
            a fright this tremendous - and one that came with a disturbing wind, 
            no less - couldn't be good.
        </p>

        <p>
            Clearly, this is a warning. Something wicked lies ahead and, 
            wherever this path leads is clearly not worth it. You turn back to 
            the main road and continue on to the Castle Town Market, as you 
            should.
        </p>

        <h3>The End</h3>
