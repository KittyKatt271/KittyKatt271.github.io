        <p>
            While venturing upon the new path could lead to somewhere new - an 
            adventure just waiting to begin - this is not prudent. You know the 
            best way to sell your wares is to head to the Castle Town Market. 
            Letting out a sigh of disappointment, you venture forth upon the 
            main road.
        </p>

        <p>
            Just as always, you soon find yourself upon the outer gates of the 
            Castle Town Market. The guards, recognizing you, immediately open up 
            the gates. You proceed through them and on to your usual spot.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you set up your booth, you can't help but wonder what lies beyond 
            the road that could have been.
        </p>
