                        further due to external factors.

                    Doctor Who's 60th anniversary special reveals the Toymaker 
                    had a hand in the Timeless Child, the invention of TV, and 
                    much more, but he may have also played a game with Captain 
                    Jack Harkness. One of the biggest twists from Russell T 
                    Davies' first stint as Doctor Who showrunner was the reveal 
                    that Torchwood's Jack Harkness would eventually become the 
                    Face of Boe - a big face floating in a jar. Frustratingly, 
                    Doctor Who TV canon has still not bridged that gap. Rose's 
                    Bad Wolf form made Jack immortal, but at some point during 
                    the millennia he was alive, the universe's randiest Time 
                    Agent became a giant head, and it remains unclear how.

                    This seems to be one of few Doctor Who mysteries RTD doesn't 
                    use the Toymaker to solve in Doctor Who's "The Giggle." When 
                    Neil Patrick Harris' villain faces David Tennant's 
                    Fourteenth Doctor in a game of cards, the Toymaker proclaims 
                    he "made a jigsaw out of your [the Doctor's] history." 
                    Speaking on Doctor Who: Unleashed, RTD explained this was 
                    intended as a loosening of the rules that could account for 
                    Doctor Who's Timeless Child retcon, the Eighth Doctor's 
                    claim about being half-human, and anything else that didn't 
                    quite fit. In a strange way, the Toymaker might have also 
                    addressed how Captain Jack transformed into the Face of Boe.

                        <p>
                            When the Toymaker is boastfully listing his many 
                            achievements since crossing into Doctor Who's main 
                            universe, he mentions, "I gambled with God - and 
                            made him into a Jack-in-the-box." The initial 
                            implication here is that Doctor Who's Toymaker made 
                            a beeline for whatever passed as the monotheistic 
                            deity of the universe, played a game with it, won, 
                            and then turned this entity into a toy for his own 
                            amusement, just as he does to the UNIT soldiers in 
                            "The Giggle." According to one theory (via X user 
                            Tigfore), however, the Toymaker's "Jack-in-the-box" 
                            remark may have been a sneaky reference to turning 
                            Jack Harkness into the Face of Boe.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Across Doctor Who seasons 1-3, the Face of Boe was treated 
                    as a big deal, with loyal followers that would accompany and 
                    care for him towards the end of his life. The 2018 audio 
                    story "Escape from New York" went further, and included a 
                    reference that suggested the Face of Boe had come to be 
                    considered a God in humanity's future. When the Toymaker 
                    says he "gambled with God," therefore, he certainly could 
                    mean Captain Jack Harkness. "Jack-in-the-box" would then be 
                    a very wry nod to the Toymaker turning Jack into a face 
                    inside a jar.

                            Using the phrase "Jack-in-the-box" to refer to the 
                            Face of Boe fits perfectly with the morbid, 
                            toy-centric sense of humor Neil Patrick Harris' 
                            version demonstrates throughout "The Giggle." More 
                            importantly, Jack Harkness was both a friend of the 
                            Doctor's and an immortal being, tickling two of the 
                            Toymaker's areas of interest. Given how long Jack 
                            was alive, it seemsinevitable that the Toymaker 
                            would have approached him. Just like the Doctor, 
                            Jack would have realized that his best bet was 
                            defeating the villain at his own game. Jack then 
                            lost, and - with all due respect to Boekind - had 
                            his trademark good looks taken away as punishment.

                <p>
                    This would actually answer two big questions hanging over 
                    the Jack Harkness-Face of Boe connection. Given that Boe is 
                    allegedly the future form taken by Jack Harkness, it seems 
                    strange that Doctor Who also mentions an entire species 
                    known as Boekind. Secondly, Jack is supposed to be immortal, 
                    but eventually dies after becoming the Face of Boe. Boekind 
                    may have been a preexisting species that the Toymaker 
                    decided was a fitting form for Jack Harkness to take, and 
                    the villain is also powerful enough to undo the TARDIS mojo 
                    keeping Jack from dying. As the Fourteenth Doctor himself 
                    admits, "the TARDIS is an idea the Toymaker would throw 
                    away."

                            Since Russell T Davies is dipping into Doctor Who 
                            lore and pulling out the Meep, Mel, and the various 
                            deep-cut Easter eggs in Tales of the TARDIS, one 
                            cannot rule out Doctor Who explaining the full story 
                            behind the Face of Boe in a future season. Due to 
                            external factors, however, this is incredibly 
                            unlikely. Controversy surrounding his initial run on 
                            the show has likely scuppered any chance that John 
                            Barrowman will return in Doctor Who season 14 and 
                            beyond, ending hopes of continuing Captain Jack's 
                            story.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Without Barrowman, recounting the story of how Jack 
                            became the Face of Boe would be tricky, which leaves 
                            blaming the Toymaker as the most straightforward 
                            answer. This also avoids the problemof "God" in 
                            Doctor Who. If the Toymaker turned the universe's 
                            actual God into a Jack-in-the-box, this not only 
                            means God no longer exists in the show's canon, but 
                            for the first time since the Tenth Doctor beat the 
                            devil, questions are raised over the nature of 
                            Doctor Who's religious mythology. If the "God" 
                            mentioned by the Toymaker was only Captain Jack, 
                            those problems no longer apply.
