                sweetened condensed milk, and a pinch of salt.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                Use a stand mixer or hand mixer and whisk until smooth.
                Set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h4>&nbsp; MAKE THE GARLIC BUTTER</h4>

                To a bowl, add the egg, melted butter, minced garlic, chopped

            <li>Mix together until combined well and set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h4>&nbsp; ASSEMBLE AND BAKE</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.<br><br></li>

            <li>
                Make 6 cuts across each bagel but do not make the cuts going all 
                the way down. Cut a small section out of each cut to make room 
                for the cream cheese filling.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                Using a piping bag or ziploc bag with the tip cut off, fill the 
                bagel with the cream cheese filling in each of the cuts.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                Once all the bagels are filled, dunk each of them in the garlic 
                butter. Fully submerge it, then let any excess drip off, and 
                place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the oven for 11 to 13 minutes or until golden brown all 
                around.
                <br>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                Once out of the oven, garnish with more chopped parsley and 
                grated parmesan. Allow to cool down and then enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
