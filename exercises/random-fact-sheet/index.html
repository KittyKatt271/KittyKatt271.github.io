            The Legend of Zelda retells the creation of their infamous land of

                "Before time began, before spirits and life existed...
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Three golden goddesses descended upon the chaos that was 
                Hyrule...

                <br>
                <br>

                Din, the goddess of power...

                <br>
                <br>

                Nayru, the goddess of wisdom...

                <br>
                <br>

                Farore, the goddess of courage....

                <br>
                <br>

                Din...With her strong flaming arms, she cultivated the land and 
                created the red earth.

                <br>
                <br>

                Nayru... Poured her wisdom onto the earth and gave the spirit 
                of law to the world.

                <br>
                <br>

                Farore...With her rich soul, produced all life forms who would 
                uphold the law.

                <br>
                <br>

                The three great goddesses, their labors completed, departed for 
                the heavens.

                <br>
                <br>

                And golden sacred triangles remained at the point where the 
                goddess left the world.

                <br>
                <br>

                Since then, the sacred triangles have become the basis of our 
                world's providence.

                <br>
                <br>

                And, the resting place of the triangles has become the Sacred 
                Realm."

                "According to the Hylian scrolls, the mythical gods descended 
                from a distant nebula to the world that was and created order 
                and life. The God of Power dyed the mountains red with fire and 
                created land. The God of Wisdom created science and wizardry and 
                brought order to nature. And the God of Courage, through justice 
                and vigor, created life - the animals that crawl the land and 
                the birds that soar in the sky. After the gods had finished 
                their work, they left the world, but not before creating a 
                symbol of their strength, a golden triangle known as the 
                Triforce. A small but powerful portion of the essence of the 
                gods was held in this mighty artifact, which was to guide the 
                intelligent life on the world of Hyrule.

                <br>
                <br>
                
                Although it was an inanimate object, the Triforce had the power 
                to bestow three titles which gave the person who received them 
                great powers: "The Forger of Strength", "The Keeper of 
                Knowledge", and "The Juror of Courage". From its hiding place in 
                the so-called Golden Land where the gods placed it, the Triforce 
                beckoned people from the outside world to seek it in the hope 
                that someone worthy of these titles would find it.
                <br>
                <br>

                With their magic infused blood, the Hylian people were endowed 
                with psychic powers and skill in wizardry. It was also said that 
                their long, pointed ears enabled them to hear special messages 
                from the gods, so they were held in high esteem by many people 
                in Hyrule. Their descendants settled in various parts of the 
                world and passed on their knowledge and magical lore to all 
                people. But in its passing, the lore was often distorted or lost 
                altogether..."
